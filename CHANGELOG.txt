2.0extra13.0:
- updated to minecraft 1.0.1 (previous were alpha/beta versions of minecraft)
    - thanks darkdiplomat for making temporary unofficial versions of my
        unofficial version in my absence!
- added ability to create Iron Bar gates and Glass Pane gates.
    - They are created exactly like [Gate] or [DGate], but instead of typing
        [Gate] or [DGate] you type:
            [IronGate]
            [IronDGate]
            [GlassGate]
            [GlassDGate]
    - You must use Iron bars for [IronGate] and [IronDGate], and glass panes
        for [GlassGate] and [GlassDGate]
    - thanks Shadow386 for the suggestion!
- added [MCX512] MessageNearby - Similar to [MC1512], but a max range can be
    set in the craftbook.properties file, in addition to using both the 3rd
    and 4th lines for the message instead of just the 4th line.
    - type the range on the FIRST line of the sign (default max is 64)
    - type a message on the 3rd and 4th lines
    - the message can use:
        %p    which will be replaced with the player's name
                - example "hello %p" will become "hello PLAYERNAME"
        /n    which will start a new line for the message (5 lines max)
        - Must use lower case letters for %p and /n
- added [MCX515] Server Log - which logs the message on the 3rd and 4th lines
    - this has no special characters to use
    - logged messages will use the default Minecraft.CraftBook logger and also
        be marked with [CB!]
- added [MCX516] S-Log Nearby - logs messages typed on the 3rd and 4th lines
    when activated.
    - type the range on the FIRST line of the sign (default max is 64)
        - the max range is shared with [MCX512] and [MCX517]
    - type a message on the 3rd and 4th lines
    - messages can use:
        %p    which will be replaced with the closest player within the set
                range. If no player is found, [NONE_FOUND] will be used instead
        /n    which will start a new line for the message (5 lines max)
        - Must use lower case letters for %p and /n
    - If a nearby player is found, and %p is used, you can send them the same
        message being logged to the server
        - This could be used as a sort of courtesy to let players know they're
            being logged or to test the message being logged.
        - To use this, on the second line of the sign type
            [MCX516]+
- added [MCX517] S-Log Nearby+ - works just like [MCX516] except it also allows
    messages to use:
        %a    which will be replaced with a list all players found within the
                set range and their distance.
        - Must use lower case letter for %a
    - the + mode [MCX517]+ will send the logged message to each of the players
        listed with %a.
    - thanks Riot for the suggestions for [MCX515], [MCX516], & [MCX517]
- added Minecart Station clearing block, which removes a player's set
    /st station
    - default block is brown wool
    - no sign is used
    - can be powered on/off with redstone
    - thanks healthyuncle for the suggestion!
- fixed bug with [MCX117] & [MCZ117] where the explosions would continue until
    the dead player finally respawned or left.
    - thanks Riot for the bug report!
- fixed bug with [Bridge] (and similar) turning grass into wood planks
    - no idea why sk89q had it that way
    - thanks Hummtaro for the bug report!

2.0extra12.0:
- updated to minecraft 1.8.1
- added ability to limit max range for [MCX203] & [MCZ203]
    Chest Collectors

        ic-chest-collector-max-range=
    - thanks Riot for the suggestion!

2.0extra11.6:
- added ability to spawn saddled pigs with [MCX200]
    - 3rd line of the sign needs to be
        Pig:1
    - thanks Emppu for the suggestion!
- added ability to right-click self-updating ICs to restart
    them. This will help with self-updating ICs that break
    from server restarts.
    - players require permission to:
        /cbrightclicksignupdate
    - recommended only for server admins
    - must right click sign with empty hand.
    - thanks Loganvz for the suggestion!
- fixed bug with repel ICs [MCU302] & [MCU303] not limiting
    the push force for negative values.
- fixed permissions for adding, removing, and editing
    password protected CBWarps.

2.0extra11.5:
- added CBWarp which is a warp system that works similar to
    the /warp command
    - this is not meant to replace the default /warp system.
        It is meant to give servers another warp list if
        needed. Such as hidden warps.
    - use /cbwarpx to create and use password protected warps
        - NOTE: passwords will have little to no encryption
        - server logs when players type in the incorrect
            password
            - this is to help show if a player is trying to
                figure out a password by guessing.
- added [MCX111] Warp - uses warps from the /warp command
- added [MCX114] CBWarp - uses warps from /cbwarp
- added [MCX115] CBWarp Pass - uses waprs from /cbwarpx
    - NOTE: Once [MCX115] is placed, it can continue using
        the warp even if the warp's password has changed.
- added the ability to heal while sitting
    - This is disabled by default
    - This will not do anything if auto-heal is on.
    - Change the "heal-while-sitting" craftbook.properties
        setting to enable.
    - thanks Loganvz for the suggestion!
- added [Sit Heal] chair
    - allows healing even if the "heal-while-sitting"
        setting is disabled
    - players require permission: /sittingcanbuildheal
        to build [Sit Heal] signs.
- fixed [MCX132] & [MCU132] hurting players
    - thanks Mercerenies for the bug report!
- fixed players staying seated when a sticky piston moves
    a stair block
    - thanks onicx4 for the bug report!

    - thanks thekeram007 for the suggestion!
- added Sitting
    - 3 new settings for the Sitting feature in the
        craftbook.properties
    - players must be given permission in the groups.txt server
        file to use the /sit command
    - by default, players need to be given /canrightclicksit 
        permission to right click wooden or cobble stairs to
        sit.
- removed temporary command /kill248 since the blocks should
    not exist any more. If you have the issue, you can still
    use an older version for the command.

2.0extra11.3:
- added [MCX206] a copy of MC1207 Flexible Set IC that has more
    restrictions
- added [MCU217] Drawbridge
- added [MCU300] Bounce Up

- added Bounce blocks and Soft Land blocks. Disabled by default.
    - To enable, set a block type for bounce-block and
        soft-land-block
    - This includes 5 new configuration settings for them
    - thanks D3athrow for letting me add the bounce feature!
- updated [MCX205] & [MCZ205] to be able to detect air blocks
    - thanks Riot for the suggestion!
- updated glass removed by features such as Area Toggle, Bridge,
    Door, etc, to put glass into chests instead of nothing.

2.0extra10:
Since I finally have a wiki, many specific details will not be added
to this change log. Details are easier to explain on a wiki than a
change log.
The wiki can be found at: http://cbx.m4411k4.com
- updated to minecraft 1.6.6
    - This involved the biggest change to CraftBook I've ever done due
        to needed multiple world support.
    - All features will need to be tested
- added custom plugin hooks. This allows other plugins to communicate
    with CraftBook. Such as creating toll bridges.
- added [MCX246] Fireball IC
- added [MCT246] Cannon IC
- added color/damage and amount minecart sorting to player "Held"
    items.
    - thanks Riot for the suggestion!
- added player inventory minecart sorting. Searches the player's
    whole inventory for matching item, color/damage, and amount
- updated [MCX200] to support spawning sitting and angry wolves
- updated [MCT233] to have a faster weather change
- updated /savearea .cbcopy files to version 2 for world support
    -version 1 .cbcopy files will default to the main world.
- updated station names for minecart sorting to be case insensitive
    - thanks Riot for the suggestion!
- updated playlists to log a couple playlist loading errors
- fixed [MC3032] having a name longer than 15 chars.
    -thanks Riot for reporting it!

- fixed music playlists causing errors when empty
    -thanks Riot for reporting it!

2.0extra9.2:
- 2 new optional properties in craftbook.properties file
- added ability to place noteblocks for music ICs on the side of the
    IC block, above the IC block, or under the IC block.
- added Radio Station IC [MCU701]
    - plays music files that Radio ICs can connect and listen to
        - The map chunk with this IC [MCU701] must be loaded.
        - Radio ICs can not listen to it without the loaded map chunk
        - To have the map chunk loaded, you will need a player nearby
        - You can also put this IC [MCU701] at spawn since spawn is
            always loaded.
            - If you place at spawn and no player is around spawn, the
                music will play very fast
    - 3rd line = song file name (just like for [MCU700])
    - 4th line = station name. This is the name Radio ICs will use to
        listen to this station.
    - example:
          line1:
          line2: [MCU701]
          line3: filename
          line4: stationname
        -If using midi files, put a ".m" at the end of "filename" just like
            for [MCU700]
    - When playing playlists (more about playlists below)
        - redstone input on the left of the IC sign = play previous song
        - redstone input on the right of the IC sign = play next song
- added Music Radio IC [MCU702]
    - connects to Radio Station ICs to listen to what the Station is playing
    - 3rd line = station name. The name of the station to connect to.
    - redstone input on the left of the IC sign = get "now playing" messages
        - These messages display the song's title and author (if provided).
        - if the redstone input is on, the messages will be sent to nearby
            players that can hear the music
        - if the redstone input is off, there will be no song information
            messages.
- added playlist support to Music ICs
    - a list of song files to play
    - inside the "cbmusic" folder, create a new folder named "playlists"
        ex: \cbmusic\playlists
    - .txt files in the "playlists" folder will be considered playlists
        - keep the .txt file names short enough to fit on a sign with ".p" at
            the end. (13 character file names)
    - inside a playlist .txt file, each song is on its own line
    - songs are listed just like how you would type it on [MCU700]
        -example:
            song1.m
            song2.m
            song3.m:6
            song4
            song5.m
        - where ":6" for song3 is the midi's speed (just like on [MCU700]) and
            song4 plays a text file song instead of a midi.
    - playlists also support messages to display to listeners inbetween songs
        - format:
            ad:message
              -or-
            ad:delay#:message
        -example:
            song1.m
            song2.m
            ad:Thanks for listening to M4411K4 radio!
            song3.m
            ad:20:Just a short break!
            song4.m
        - lines that start with "ad:" are considered messages to display
        - The "20" in the "ad:20:Just a short break!" example is the delay time
            in seconds.
            - If the delay is left out, the delay will be 10 seconds.
        - Messages also support line breaks <br>
    - To play playlists, on the 3rd line of [MCU700] or [MCU701] type the file
        name folowed by ".p" (without the quotes)
        -example:
            line1:
            line2: [MCU701]
            line3: playlist.p
            line4: stationname
- added Tune IC [MCU705]
    - plays a short tune that's written on the IC sign
    - format:
        instrument#pitch#octave#pitch#octave#pitch#octave# etc...
        - example:
            0F3a2
        - where 0 is harp, F is F#, 3 is octave 3, a is normal note a, and 
            2 is octave 2
    - pitch#octave# can also be replaced with a delay number
        -example:
            0F3-9a2
        - where - means delay and 9 is for 9 beats to skip
    - you can also change instruments during a tune
        -example:
            0F3-9a21d2E3
        -where the 1 after 'a2' means to switch to bass drum. The notes after
            it will then use the bass drum instrument
    - tunes can be typed on the 3rd and 4th line of the IC sign
    - 3rd line and 4th lines are combined
    - To change the beat's speed, put the speed# followed by ':' in FRONT of the
        tune, which is different from [MCU700]
        -example
            3:0F3-0a2
- added admin music commands:
    - permissions should only be given to Admins
    - these commands are meant to help with any server lag that may be caused
        by playing music
    - type /cbmusic to see the commands in game
        - to stop all playing music
            /cbmusic stopall
        - to stop only music that loops
            /cbmusic stoploops
        - to completely disable all music ICs from playing
            /cbmusic disable
        - to enable or reset music ICs. This will have music ICs playing again
          after a disable
            /cbmusic enable
        - to reset music ICs (works the same as /cbmusic enable)
            /cbmusic restart
- added new text song format "tune1" which uses the Tune IC [MCU705]'s format
- added ability to dispense carts by powering the [Dispenser] sign instead of
    the Chest
    - thanks Jahmaican for the suggestion!
- bugfix, the first tracks of midi files are now included.
- bugfix for [MCX236], [MCZ236], [MCX238] & [MCZ238] Distance Fake Weather and
    Distance Hide Weather ICs having conflicts between manual and self-updating
    versions

2.0extra9.1:
- For weather ICs, please remember not all biomes have weather.
- added Weather Control IC [MCT233]
    - Takes in 3 inputs
    - When the front input is turned "on" it will set the weather based on the
        left and right inputs.
    - left input = weather on/off
    - right input = stormy weather (chance of lightning) on/off
    - Example:
        - If the left input is "on" and right input is "off" the weather will
            turn on when the front input is turned "on"
        - If the left input is "off" the weather will turn off when the front
            input is turned "on"
    - This works similar to [MC3231] Time Control
- added Simple Weather Control IC [MCX233]
    - 3rd line = duration. Can be left blank. Duration is from 1 to 24000.
    - mode t = storym weather (chance of lightning)
        -example:
            line1:
            line2: [MCX233]t
            line3:
            line4:
- added Weather Check IC [MCX230] & [MCZ230]
    - output is "on" when it is raining/snowing
    - [MCZ230] is self-updating version.
- added Stormy Weather Check IC [MCX231] & [MCZ231]
    - output is "on" when the storm mode is on
    - NOTE! The weather can be off and this can be on!
        - meaning even if it's not raining/snowing the storm mode can be on
        - storms will only happen when it's raining/snowing, but the mode
            can be on.
        - when the storm mode is on while it is NOT raining/snowing, nothing
            happens.
        - when storm mode is on while it IS raining/snowing then
            there are chances that lightning will strike in the world.
    - [MCZ231] is self-updating version.
- added False Weather IC [MCX235]
    - Makes players see rain/snow even when it is not raining/snowing.
    - 3rd line = specific player or group. Can be left blank.
        - If left blank, all players will be effected.
        - specific player example:
            line1:
            line2: [MCX235]
            line3: p:PlayerName
            line4:
        - No spaces allowed in in names
        - specific hMod group example:
            line1:
            line2: [MCX235]
            line3: g:GroupName
            line4:
- added Distance False Weather IC [MCX236] & [MCZ236]
    - Makes players see false rain/snow when they enter the distance range, and
        removes the false rain/snow when they leave the distance range.
    - 3rd line = distance. Distance must be from 1 to 127
    - 4th line = message to players in distance range. Can be left blank.
        - It would be kind to let players know they're seeing fake rain/snow :P
    - When using the manual version [MCX236], turning this IC "off" will stop
        the fake rain/snow for all players that were affected.
- added Hide Weather IC [MCX237]
    - Hides the rain/snow from players.
        - Snow will still cover the ground and rain will still put out fires,
            but players will be unable to see the rain drops and snow flakes.
    - 3rd line = exactly the same as [MCX235] False Weather IC mentioned above
- added Distance Hide Weather IC [MCX238] & [MCZ238]
    - Same as [MCX236] & [MCZ236] Distance False Weather IC, but hides the
        weather.
    - 3rd & 4th lines = same as [MCX236] & [MCZ236] Distance False Weather IC
- added Holy Smite IC [MCX256]
    - 3rd line = y-offset. Can be left blank.
        - You can set the lightning to go higher or lower than the IC block
    - 4th line = radius. Can be left blank. Max radius is 5.
    - mode 1 = empty circle
        - example:
            line1:
            line2: [MCX256]1
            line3:
            line4:
        - This will cause the lightning to only hit around the IC block leaving
            the center unharmed.
- added y-offset to Lightning IC [MCX255]
    - offset is placed on 3rd line like [MCX256] above.
- added ability to spawn Charged Creepers to [MCX200]
    - example:
        line1:
        line2: [MCX200]
        line3: Creeper:1
        line4:
- added Midi file settings support
    - Still more work needed for the music player ICs. Most of my time went
        into weather controls.
    - The settings currently let you
        - pick which instruments to use for each midi track.
        - default ticks per beat value
        - pick specific tracks to play.
    - There are more options, but they don't do anything currently.
    - examples will be placed in the forums.
- bugfix for short IC signs causing player kicks.
    - thanks Riot for the report!
- bugfix for [MCZxxx] self-updating ICs not being part of the
    "enable-self-triggered-ics" setting.
- bugfix for removing passwords

2.0extra9:
- updated to minecraft 1.5x
- added Lightning IC [MCX255]
    -took me less than a minute to make, so I'll probably add more to it
- added Music/Midi player [MCU700]
    -This is not done yet!
    -I know nothing about music, so this is difficult for me to get it right
    -Currently plays music to nearby players.
        -I plan to add more types such as playing to everyone, and more admin
        controls.
    -To play MIDI:
        -place .mid file into "cbmusic" server folder. If there is no "cbmusic"
            folder, create one.
        -In game, build an IC as normal and type on the sign:
            line1:
            line2: [MCU700]
            line3: songname.m
            line4:
        -where "songname" is the .mid file name and ".m" let's the IC know it's
            a midi file
        -Behind the IC where the lever usually goes, place a NoteBlock.
            -I hope to add support for more NoteBlock positions, but currently
            it has to be behind the IC
        -When ever you turn on the redstone wire for the IC, it will load and
            play. It will stop when you turn off the redstone wire.
    -To play player made text music
        -Same setup as MIDI, but for the song name don't add ".m" at the end
        -How to write the text music will need to be provided else where since
        it's best seen with an example, and the example is too big for a
        changelog.
- added P mode for MCX112
    -This will force the pressure plate the player was on top of to turn "off"
    -To set the P mode, place next to [MCX112] like:
    [MCX112]P
    -thanks leecher123 for the suggestion/bug report
- bugfix (i hope) for players getting stuck in the ground using MCX112
    -thanks leecher123 for the bug report and fix suggestion!
- bugfix for missing permissions for MC1510
    -thanks Riot for the report!

2.0extra8.2:
- added ability for storage carts to [Collect] and [Deposit] to Dispenser blocks
    - thanks wire for the suggestion!
- added new "All" mode for minecart [Dispenser]
    - On the third line of a [Dispenser] sign, type "All" without the quotes.
    - This will collect all minecart types and dispense all minecart types
    - Currently it has an order in which it dispenses
        - It will attempt to dispense storage carts first. If a storage cart
            is not found, or can not be built from a minecart and chest, then
            it attempts to dispense a powered cart. If it can't dispense that
            then it attempts to dispense a regular cart.
    - Please note that to collect only storage or only powered carts, you can
        use the existing modes of "Storage" and "Powered"
    - thanks leecher123 for the suggestion!
- bugfix for [Collect] and [Deposit] not collecting damaged items correctly.
    - Now if the color/damage value is not added to a specified item on the
        third line, it will collect/deposit all of the same item id type.
        So a [Collect] sign with just "35" on the third line will collect
        all wool of any color.
    - thanks leecher123 for the bug report!

2.0extra8.1:
- added ability to specify minecart boost speeds in the settings.
    - Adds 5 new properties in the "craftbook.properties" file.
- added storage minecart sorting based on the first item (SCI) in the storage
    minecart or anywhere (SCI+) in the storage minecart.
    - For sorting with just the first item, on the [Sort] sign use:
        SCI:itemID#
        or
        SCI:itemID#:amount#
        or
        SCI:itemID#@color#:amount#
    Example:
        SCI:351@9:12
        will sort if there is 12 pink dye in the first slot of the storage cart.
    - For sorting with an item match in any storage cart slot, It is the same as
        above, but with a '+' at the end of "SCI"
    Example:
        SCI+:351@9:12
        will sort if there is 12 pink dye, but anywhere in the storage cart.
    - This will work on other minecart features that use sort such as [Launch]
        and [CartLift]
- added ability for minecart [Deposit] and [Collect] to only collect an item
    of a certain type and a certain amount.
    - On a [Deposit] or [Collect] sign, put on the 3rd line:
        itemID#
        or
        itemID#:amount#
        or
        itemID#@color#:amount#
    Example:
        35@5:4
        will collect or deposit 4 green wool
    - The amount# is optional.
- added self-triggered "Is player above?" [MCZ116] and "Player mine" [MCZ117]
    - It is recommended to use the regular version, but I have a feeling
        players will just add clocks to the regular vesrions anyways.
- added some repeat call protection for [Deposit] and [Collect]
    - Previously this feature attempted to repeat itself about 6 times, when only
        one time was needed. So that's 6x each slot of the storage cart and chests
    - This will now only repeat itself for the same storage cart every 2 seconds.
    - This protection will only work for [Collect] when a [Collect] sign is used.
- bug fix for minecart eject. Thanks to all that reported it!
- bug fix for duplicated minecart depositing. Thanks wire for reporting it!
- bug fix for minecart [Deposit]. I'm not sure it ever worked properly.
    - A complete recode of it was done. This may not be the best code but it
        is *for sure* better (performance and design) than what was originally
        used.

2.0extra8:
- updated to minecraft 1.4
- added a little more color support and support for some new blocks.

2.0extra7.2:
- added new-line support for Page Reader.
    <br> is used to split a page to a new line.
    Example: The brown<br>fox.
    Will show as:
    The brown
    fox.
- temporary fix for bookshelf drops until hMod is hopefully updated. Thanks
    for the bug report TheRaph!

2.0extra7.1:
- fixed MCX200 not spawning colored sheep. Thanks for the bug report tkausl!
- fixed redstone netherrack error. Thanks for the bug report Nu11u5!
- temporary fix for apple drops until hMod is hopefully updated. Thanks for the
    bug report Joy!
- added missing [Dispenser] sign checks. Thanks for the bug report countrylonja!

2.0extra7:
- updated to minecraft 1.3
- added ability to change location of [MC1262] Light sensor location.
    - on the fourth line of the sign, you can set the x, y, and z offset from the
        default light sensor position, which is right above the [MC1262] block
        - an example:    3:4:-1
          this sets the sensor 3 blocks away from the original position in the
          x-direction, 4 blocks up, and -1 block in the z-direction

2.0extra6:
[ICs]:
- added Password Command [MCX121] and [MCZ121], where [MCZ121] is self triggering.
    -thanks TimeLordX4 for the suggestion!
    -Specify password name reference on the third line of the sign.
    -There are 4 commands to use:
        -Toggle, set on/off, or check state, just like /mcx120, but with a
         password to input
            /mcx121 [pass name] [password] <on/off/state>
        -Ability to add and change passwords, or see if a password exists
            /mcx121pass add [pass name] [new password]
            /mcx121pass change [pass name] [current password] [new password]
            /mcx121pass has [pass name]
        -Ability to remove passwords. RECOMMENDED FOR ADMINS ONLY!!!
         Meant for times when users forget passwords.
            /mcx121remove [pass name]
        -The list of currently loaded password command ICs. Works same as /mcx120list
            /mcx121list
    -Incorrect passwords are logged to the server to help show if a player is trying
        to guess passwords.
    -Passwords are stored in the mcx121.txt located in the world's craftbook folder
    -Passwords have a very low encryption, so low it should not even be considered 
        encryption.
- updated MCU440 to have a set amount of time to remain on, and a mode to swap the
    output states. Also updated name to MONOFLOP
    -thanks clouder for the suggestions and the better name!
    -To set the amount of time for the output to remain "on", type on the third line:
	    [count#]:[clock rate#]:[on count#]
        Ex:
        10:5:4
        where [on count] is the number of "ticks" to remain on.
[Minecarts]:
- added new minecart Delay block. Default is Yellow Wool (id# 4). Uses [Delay] sign.
    -Have the [Delay] sign face the direction you want the cart to go after the delay
    -Place amount of time (in seconds) for minecarts to be held on the Third line of
        sign.
- added new minecart Load block. Default is Cyan Wool (id# 9). Optional [Load] sign.
    -If there is no [Load] sign, minecarts will try to load players about 3 blocks
        away in any direction.
    -If there is a [Load] sign, minecarts will try to load players about 3 blocks
        in the direction the [Load] sign is facing.
    -Due to the potential to cause frustration on other players, this ability can be
        disabled.
        -To disable, in the craftbook.properties, set the following value from:
            minecart-enable-loadblock=true
                to
            minecart-enable-loadblock=false
- added new minecart collision "modes". These modes are added in an attempt to deal
    with the slower empty minecarts on the tracks.
    -Please note that these modes arn't perfect
    -Slow moving minecarts will not use these modes, and have a regular collision.
    -There are currently only 2 modes (push had a major problem so I took it out)
        -Default mode - no change to how collision works currently.
        -Ghost mode - sets player filled carts into a sort of "ghost" mode where they
            go through *empty* minecarts including storage and powered.
            -Known issue:
                -Causes empty minecarts that the player cart went through to sometimes
                    become lightly "pulled" by the player cart. Like a gust of wind
                    went by.
        -Plow mode - Player carts will destroy empty carts on contact.
            -This will not destroy storage minecarts.
            -The destroyed carts will end up in the player's inventory.
    -To set the modes, in the craftbook.properties, change the value:
        minecart-collision-type=default
           to
        minecart-collision-type=ghost
           OR
        minecart-collision-type=plow
- added a helper mode for the new collision type modes. Disabled by default
    -This was mostly used for collision modes that didn't work and are now removed, so
        this helper doesn't do too much anymore, but can still provide some minor
        improvements to the collision modes.
    -This is disabled by default because it "helps" at the cost of more resources
    -To enable it, in the craftbook.properties, change
        minecart-enable-collision-type-helper=false
            to
        minecart-enable-collision-type-helper=true
- fixed (hopefully) duplicating minecarts with the destroy on exit mode set on
    -thanks Joy and DrTasslehoff for letting me know about it!

2.0extra5.1:
- added new ICs, "PLAYER ABOVE?" [MCX116] and "PLAYER MINE" [MCX117]
    -thanks insaneHacker999 for the suggestion!
    -both are constructed the same way.
        -If the third line is blank, the ICs will output "on" if *any* player is above
            the IC block. And "off" otherwise.
        -The third line can contain group names or player names.
            -To specify a  group:      g:GROUPNAME
            -To specify a player:      p:PLAYERNAME
    -MCX117 will output if specified player is above AND will explode a tnt at the
        player's position.

2.0extra5:
- added color block support for minecart control block features
- added minecart Direction block. Default block is Red Wool. No sign.
    -when a player is on top of the Direction block (in a minecart), the minecart will
        stop. The player then needs to face the direction they wish to go and type the
        command: /cbgo
- added minecart Cart Lift block. Default block is Orange wool. Uses [CartLift] sign.
    -This works just like the [Sort] block except it "sorts" teleporting minecarts up or
        down. Arrival messages can be placed on the *first* line of the [CartLift] sign.
    -This currently contains some messages that spam. It is left in since this is a new
        feature, and the messages help inform the players what they are missing. These
        spam messages should never be seen if everything is configured correctly.
- added minecart Launch block. Default block is Light Green wool. Uses [Launch] sign.
    -This works similar to the [Sort] block, except if a sort line is left blank, it will
        accept any cart except the type that is on the other sort line. If both sort lines
        are left blank, it will launch any full cart, and stop any empty cart. The 3rd
        line is for launching. The 4th line is for stopping.
- added hidden switch ability to Page Reader: [Book][X]
    -If a direct redstone wire is pointing to the [Book][X] sign, it will set the hidden
        switches to the redstone wire input.
- added new IC [MCU440] which is a special count down timer.
    -When the input is "on" it will start the count down timer, and the timer will not
        stop and can not be reset, until the timer has finished. To stop it you will need
        to wait, or destroy it.
    -Use the third line to specify the number to count down from, and the clock rate.
        Ex:    10:5
        This will count down from 10 at the clock rate of 5
    -Mode '1' will set this IC to toggle the output back "off" after one clock cycle of
        being "on" from reaching 0.

2.0extra4:
- added "fix" for self-triggered ICs (wireless receivers [MC0111], clocks [MC0420], etc)
    that stop working on server restarts.
    This is disabled by default.
    The fix *may* cause server lag depending on how many players you have on your server.
    I should be able to improve this by a lot if I can learn more about map chunks.
    To enable it, in the craftbook.properties set "chunk-updated-self-triggered-ic-list="
        to "true"
- updated blockbag to recognize the new blocks and colors. Still has issues with colors.
- fixed transporter[MCX112]/destination[MCU113] player warp rotation.
- updated destinations [MCU113] to now be "on" when created.
- added ability for [MCX200] to spawn mobs in water
[New ICs]
- added command controlled ICs MCX120 and wireless MCZ120.
    You can control MCX120 and MCZ120 with the command: /mcx120 [band name] <on/off/state>
    Where [band name] is the band/network name on MCX120 or MCZ120.
    /mcx120 [band name]       - will toggle the IC on or off
    /mcx120 [band name] on    - will set the IC on
    /mcx120 [band name] off   - will set the IC off
    /mcx120 [band name] state - will display a message that the IC is on or off
    Please remember that MCX120 needs to be manually updated! MCZ120 will automatically be
        updated.
    For admins/mods, the command /mcx120list will list all currently loaded band/network
        names for this IC.
        The band/network names will show up in green if "on", red if "off", and gray if
            your server is doing odd things with this IC. Should never be gray, but can be.
- added new bridge ICs MCX207 and MCX209, and door ICs MCX208 and MCX210
    These are like advanced versions of the existing [Bridge] and [Door].
    You are able to specify a width, length, and an up/down offset.
    The max currently are:
        width   = 11
        length  = 30
        up/down = between -10 and 10
    There is no settings currently (if ever) to change these max values.
    MCX207 and MCX208 are versions that are not allowed to "force" or delete existing blocks.
        They can still have the "force" option on them, but it will not actually force/delete.
    To use:
        <first line blank>
        [MCX???]
        blockID#:color#
        width:length
    The color# is optional, and you can just have the blockID# by itself instead.
    The third line can also have the "force" option added in front:
        f:blockID#:color#
    where "f" is the force option
    The fourth line can also have the up/down offset:
        width:length:offset
[Page Reader]
- added Page Reader. There are 4 new "craftbook.properties" settings for this.
    Page Reader reads "pages" in a sequence rather than randomly. In addition,
        it reads from many different .txt file sources. The .txt files are stored
        in the folder "cbbooks" and in global or player namespace folders. So for
        example, you are able to read from page 5 of a "book" .txt file written
        by PlayerA, and also read from pages 3 to 14 of a "book" .txt file stored
        in the "global" folder.
    Page Readers are created by placing a sign on a bookshelf block with:
        namespace
        [Book]
        book
        pages
    By default, players have access to their own namespace and the global namespace.
        To access the global namespace, type "@" without the quotes on the first line.
    The "book" on the third line is the .txt file name without ".txt" at the end.
    Pages on the fourth line can be left blank. The Page Reader will only read from
        page 1 if left blank. To read more pages, put on the fourth line: "start#:end#"
        where start# and end# are page numbers divided by ":".
    When reading through a range of pages (such as pages 3 to 14), you can *reset*
        back to the start page by left-clicking the bookshelf.
    Book titles are stored in the first line of the book .txt file.
- added ability to *write* books for Page Reader.
    Using this feature is NOT recommended! Disabled by default.
    This allows groups with /cbpage or /admincbpage command permissions to write
        "books" in-game. So they will be creating, editing, and deleting "book" .txt
        files on the server.
    This was added for servers with members that are highly trusted and have no
        direct access to server files.
    Writing pages in-game has more limits (and frustration) than directly editing the
        .txt files.
    If writing pages using the in-game commands, any pages after the max pages
        allowed will be deleted! By default, the max page is 20, so page 21 and up
        will be deleted if using the in-game commands.
    Pages from in-game writing also have a max character limit of 400 characters by
        default.
    Again, directly editing the .txt file has no page or character limit, although it
        is recommended to stay within the limits for server resource reasons.
    The command /cbpage only allows access to the player's book folder.
    The command /admincbpage allows access to any book folder, such as other player's
        book folders and the global folder.

2.0extra3:
- re-added very old ability to toggle single input IC's from
    any side (front, left, or right).
- added new ability to swap the inputs and outputs for 3 input ICs and/or 3 output ICs.
    Can not swap single input or single output. To swap inputs and outputs just
    type something like: "[MCxxxx]abcdef" without quotes. "abc" stands for the input
    arrangement, and "def" for the output arrangement. So you can swap inputs
    by switching around the letters like "bca", or the outputs with "fde". You can also
    type in a swap for just one set if you want, such as "[MCxxxx]edf" which will just
    swap the outputs. 
- added new UISO IC type

- fixed minecart collector/depositor going past max amount for single stacks, which also
    allowed armor/tools to be repaired.
- added color items support to minecart collector/depositor
- fixed duplication bug with chest dispenser MC1202

- added new IC's. Sorry for the poor naming, but again, I'm trying to express which ones
    will be removed when the official CraftBook is ready
- MCX112 - Transporter. Transports players to matching destinations. Third line is for
    destination IC name. Fourth line is for optional message. There is also a
    "transporter pad" mode when typing "[MCX112]p" without the quotes, on the second line.
    The 'p' must be lower case!
    This transporter pad mode will teleport players from 2 blocks infront of the sign, and
    2 blocks (or higher) up. This allows players to be able to use wood/stone plates to
    teleport by having redstone under it and linked to the MCX112 sign. You can have
    multiple teleporters for a single destination.
- MCU113 - Destination. Please note the "U" in MCU113. The destionation the players that
    are teleported by MCX112 will go to. The third line is the name of the destination that
    teleporters need to use to link together.  Destinations can be turned on and off with
    redstone wire.
- MCX200 - Mob Spawner. Same as MC1200, but adds support for colored sheep, squids, and
    ghasts. To create a colored sheep, on the third line type "Sheep:ID" without the quotes.
    Where "ID" is a color id number (0-15).
- MCX201 - Item Spawner. Same as MC1201, but adds "damage" support which allows you to
    spawn colored dyes, wool, and the different logs. To spawn items with color/damage type
    "item:id" without quotes. "item" is the item name or number, and "id" is the
    damage/color value (0-15).
- MCX202 - Chest Spawner. Same as MCX202 and MC1202.


2.0previewX2o:
- Updated for minecraft_servero.jar
- Fixed arrow shooters shooting snowballs
- Added snow ball shooters [MCX242] & barrage [MCX243], and egg shooters
    [MCX244] & barrage [MCX245]
- Please note that I chose "MCX" to symbolize my custom MCxxxx that will most
    likely be removed when switching over to the official CraftBook. I have
    no plans to patch them in when the official CraftBook is ready.

2.0previewX1:
- Custom update for 1.2_01 server update. Contains some unreleased content and
    fixes, such as MC1250 (fireworks)
- Fixes redstone pumpkin orientation - from Kerden
- Fixes redstone [Area] toggle

2.0preview11:
- Added MC1260/MC0260 (water sensor), MC1261/MC0261 (lava sensor),
    MC1262/MC0262 (light sensor).
- Added [DGate], a gate sign with a very small search radius (best
    used with redstone).

2.0preview10:
- Added the ability to sort minecarts based on their type with the
    minecart sort block. Use "Storage", "Powered", or "Minecart".
- Added extra error catching for the chunk finder.
- Fixed NearbyChestBlockBag not supporting double chests.
- Fixed ConcurrentModificationException in ChunkFinder.

2.0preview9:
- Fixed self-triggered ICs not loading reliably on server/chunk load and
    plugin reload.

2.0preview8:
[Toggleable areas]
- Toggleable areas have been overhauled. Now they are saved per-user and
    no other user can toggle another user's areas (without permission).
    Existing area files will have to be moved to
    world/craftbook/copyareas/global
    and have ".cbcopy" be appended to their filenames. These areas will
    be in the global namespace.
- New [Area] sign replaces [Toggle] sign. This new sign has namespace
    support (3rd line). Leave blank to set it as the namespace for your
    own player or use "@" for the global namespace (if you have permission).
    The fourth line indicates the other state to switch to when the
    area is turned off (best used with redstone) -- use "-" to indicate
    the action of doing nothing and leave blank to clear (default behavior).
- Toggle area signs can now be triggered with redstone.
- Fixed toggle areas dropping items.
- Fixed packet spam caused by toggling areas.
[Redstone]
- Added 2-tick propagation delay to ICs and redstone-powered mechanisms.
    Removes old recursion limit method of infinite loop prevention.
- Added redstone netherstone (disabled by default). This allows you to
    toggle fire with redstone.
- All redstone devices can now take redstone current input on a level
    above the actual device, allowing you to wire pumpkins from
    above, for example (note: you still should not put wires on top of
    pumpkins as they will be removed by Minecraft).
[ICs]
- New 3I3O family with 3 inputs and 3 outputs.
- Added MC3040 (multiplexer), MC4000 (full adder), MC4010 (half adder),
    MC4100 (full subtractor), MC4110 (half subtractor),
    MC3032 (JK negative edge-triggered flip flop), MC3101 (down counter),
    MC4200 (dispatcher), MC1202 (chest dispenser),
    MC0020 (self-triggering random bit),
    MC0111 (self-triggering reciever), MC0230 (self-triggering day check),
    MC1240 (arrow shooter), MC1241 (arrow barrage), and
    MC0420 (self-triggering clock).
- New MC3033 (RS NAND latch) replaces defunct MC3031.
- MC1200 (mob spawner) now supports riders. Specify the rider on the
    fourth line.
- Changed MC1110 to output the input.
- Allowed the set block ICs to displace a block ("force" must be the
    fourth line). 
- Blocked the dispensing/creation of pre-Alpha cloth blocks with ICs.
- Added support for self-triggering ICs. No more clocks on recievers!
- Added MC5001, a variant of MC5000 using the 3 input, 3 output layout.
- Added support for custom ICs using existing PLC languages.
- Added new redstone-plcs-require-permission configuration.
- Added /listics command.
- Fixed issue with the 32nd slot of Perlstone's tables.
- Fixed chest dispenser IC being able to dispense -1 of an item.
[Block bags]
- Overhauled block bag system for bridges, gates, etc. Now multiple
    block bags can be used simultaneously.
- New administrator-only sign-based infinite block bags.
- Fixed issue with item duplication with the nearby-chests block bag
    (this may be obsolete with Minecraft beta).
- The nearby-chests block bag should no longer break between Minecraft
    updates, pending update of hMod.
- Removed the requirement of the nearby chest block bag needing one item in
    the chest to begin with.
[Minecarts]
- Added minecart sort control block. This allows you to switch track 
    direction based on criteria (such as whether the cart is empty, if
    the passenger is of a certain hMod group, if the passenger is holding
    a certain item, etc.). It is currently not possible to filter by
    mob type inside the minecart.
- Minecart station blocks now continually push when activated. To pulse
    (old behavior), put "Pulse" on the third or fourth line.
- The minecart dispenser can now dispense onto anything.
- Minecart dispensers will now collect the contents of storage minecarts
    and store them.
- Minecart dispensers can now dispense other types of minecarts by
    specifying "Storage" or "Powered" on the 3rd line. If a type is
    specified, minecarts of that type will also be stored (instead of
    breaking apart minecarts into their respective craftable pieces).
- Minecart dispensers will now push dispensed minecarts if Push is on the
    fourth line of the sign.
- The minecart trigger block has been dropped.
- A new deposit minecart block can deposit a storage minecart's contents
    into adjacent chests or deposit the contents of chests into a storage
    minecart automatically.
- Redstone currents can now be put on the same level as the tracks
    for minecart control blocks.
- Added an empty minecart delay that will remove empty minecarts after
    left unoccupied by players for a certain amount of time.
- Added an option to destroy minecarts on exit of them.
- Fixed the minecart dispenser not collecting carts that were on a slope.
- Fixed issue where minecarts significantly slowed down on pressure plates.
- Fixed minecart ejector blocks so they should now more accurately
    eject players now so that they won't fall through.
- Fixed issue with station blocks not working well if the sign was only
    one block underneath the station block.
- Fixed an issue where changing the station block type to something other
    than obsidian did not work correctly.
[Cauldrons]
- Added per-group permissions for cauldrons.
- Added reload-cauldron console command. 
- If the cauldron recipes file is missing, the current working directory
    will now be printed.
- Fixed potential issue with the cauldron dropping items.
[Mechanisms]
- Bridges can now cut through snow.
- New doors are a vertical form of bridges. Use [Door Up] and [Door Down]
    and [Door End]. They work like bridge signs, although you have to
    specify a direction that the door is in (unlike bridges).
- New hidden redstone switches. Put a sign with [X] as the second line next
    to a block (either next to it, on top, or below) and then put switches
    right next to the sign at right angles. While holding no item, right
    click the block to toggle the switch(es).
[Misc]
- New /reload CraftBook command reloads CraftBook's configuration. /reload *
    can be used to reload other plugins (utilizing the same system)
    in addition to hMod as well.
- Version detection should now be more accurate, working even if you reload
    the plugin.
- Various messages were added during feature setup (such as bridge setup)
    in order to guide players. This may be too noisy so it may be removed
    or at least toned down in the future.
- Fixed issue where the elevator could drop players into a deadly fall
    or put players inside blocks. Now the player is simply not teleported
    and is informed instead.

1.4:
- Added MC5000, a programmable logic chip utilizing the PerlStone
    language. Contributed by Lymia.
- Gates can now displace lava in addition to water.
- Minecarts can now be controlled by hitting the cart from within it.
- Added a minecart message control block that will print a message to a
    player's chat when s/he passes over the block in a minecart.
- Added minecart ejection control block to eject the player.
- Added reverse and directed reverse minecart control blocks.
- New minecart dispensers that will pick up minecarts that hit it (a chest)
    and will dispense carts when given a redstone current.
- Added configuration options to change the minecart control block types.
- Replaced the minecart coast factor with a function to hinder the
    gradual slow down of unoccupied minecarts.
- New experimental minecart trigger block that toggles switches on
    the side of the block (doesn't work too swell yet).
- Pressure plates should now no longer bring minecarts to a dead stop.
- Station signs can now be only one block below the station block.
- Minecart station blocks now give a slightly stronger boost.
- MC1200 now spawns mobs in the first free block above the block behind
    the IC sign.
- MC1201 now spawn mobs above the block behind the IC sign.
- Added MC1025 that places a block two blocks above the block
    behind the IC sign.
- Added MC1026 that places a block two blocks below the block
    behind the IC sign.

1.3.1:
- Fixed bug with MC1201.

1.3:
- Added MC3020 (2-input XOR gate), MC3002 (3-input AND),
    MC3003 (3-input NAND), MC3021 (2-input XNOR), MC3030 (RS NOR latch),
    MC3031 (RS NAND latch), MC3034 (D rising edge-triggered flip flop),
    MC3035 (D level-triggered flip flop), MC3231 (time control),
    MC1201 (dispenser).
- Minecart booster and station blocks added. They were accidentally added
    by 1.2.1 got out, so many of you have already been running it. I didn't
    mean to have them get into the main CraftBook branch yet -- but they
    have. Gold blocks underneath a track give a 2x boost, gold ore gives
    25% boost, slow sand gives a 50% slow down, and gravel gives a
    20% slow down. Station blocks are made of obsidian -- wire them
    and have a low input to stop all carts that pass over. Put a sign
    two blocks below facing the direction that you want to go and
    give a high input to have the cart pushed in the sign's direction
    (no diagonals!).
- Improved redstone triggering so that redstone devices to the right/left
    and above of an input block but have nothing under them will not prevent
    trigerring.
- Fixed for the MC update.

1.2.1:
- Added a recursion limit to the redstone processing.
- Increased the height that mobs spawned at with MC1200 by one block up.

1.2:
- Water and lava can now be used reliably as ingredients. Specify
    moving water/lava, not the stationary water/lava.
- Rewrote redstone triggering for bridges and gates. They will now not
    trigger by redstone as easily -- they now act more like doors and
    other redstone components in that the wire must run up to the sign
    and not just merely pass by it. Note that you can also run wires
    directly underneath the sign and that will work.
- Added redstone integrated circuits. They compact complicated and
    otherwise impossible components into very small functional blocks.
- Pumpkin redstone input triggering has been expanded so that you can lead
    wires up to it instead of only under it. Note that you should not
    put redstone components above pumpkins as pumpkins tend to 'eat' the
    redstone items.
- CraftBook now has conditional hook registration so that it will not
    completely fail if a feature of hMod is not available for
    whatever reason.
- New ammeter (coal) can be right clicked on redstone components to get
    their current level.
- Bridges can now cut through water, allowing you to make flat flood gates
    in addition to vertical flood gates (with the gate feature). This also
    applies to lava so that you can make lava flood gates.
- Fixed the /elevator permission not working, added /togglearea
    and /bridge as permissions.
- Added create permissions that allow you to restrict the *creation* of
    features (such as bridges and gates). check-create-permissions must
    be enabled (default not).
- Bookshelf and apple drops should now occur at the place of the block
    and not at the player's feet.
- Updated for the new server update.
- Caught IOException thrown by the new properties class in hMod.

1.1:
- Pumpkins can be toggled off and on (between their lit and unlit states) by
    putting redstone under the pumpkin.
- Bridges now support redstone. Wire to the sign.
- Gates now support redstone. Just wire the sign itself.
- Bridge signs can now be *below* the bridge and out of view.
- Bridges can now be made out of other blocks (although the entire bridge
    has to be of one type). Change the list of allowable blocks in
    CraftBook's properties file.
- The maximum length of bridges can now be configured.
- [I] can be used instead of [|] for light switches.
- You can now do 'grass1:dirt*3,sapling:grass*3' for cauldron
    configuration (multipliers and item names). Comments can also now
    start with the sharp (#) sign.

0.4:
- Added the bridge.
- Added toggle-able areas.
- Added chest support to prevent item farming.
- Apple drop chance can be a decimal number. Now use -1 to disable entirely.
- Added support for setting permissions for each function so only some
    groups can use some functions.
- Fixed sign posts not working for some functions.
- Added the ability to change the "you pick out a book..." message for the
    book reading feature.

0.3:
- b123 (Halloween update) compatible.

0.2:
- Added the elevator.
- Added the cauldron.
- Added apple drops.
- Added bookshelf drops.
- Made book reading code able to handle the first and last lines of a file.
- Made the gate toggle range slightly larger so you can toggle larger gates
    and you don't have to have the sign up very high.

0.1:
- Initial release.
